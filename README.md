# PostgresQL using Docker

This docker-compose.yaml file will set up a PostgresQL image in a docker container.
This method is much more convenient than manually setting up a new Postgres database.
The image is based on Postgres 15 and Alpine 3.
Alpine is very popular for Docker containers because of its incredibly small size.
